[b]IMPORTANT[/b] Make sure to disable "Switch Vanilla Weapons Calibers?" in Zulib Weapons Core to OFF

[b]0.1 Release Note:[/b] Everything is functional but balanced feedback is welcome. If any weapons feel too strong or too weak in comparison to your expectations then please share your opinion. We will appreciate it greatly.

Balance and patch most of the guns of MoW to work with Rato's Mod.

Unpatched weapons won't drop and won't appear on Bobby Ray's
